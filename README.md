# Sudoku

Updated August 10, 2020

I wrote sudoku for gaining some experience in programming. This is my first programming project in Python, so I followed some instruction on Youtube videos, especially A Plus Coding's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLryDJVmh-ww0J6BDQrdLtRyNOv4Lym_xo), to finish the interface prototype. As I learned more about pygame and Python's syntax, I wrote the rest of the program independently, especially legality of numbers. There are many items I need to improve in the future:

  1. There are many bugs that I cannot fix so far
  2. The user interface lacks setting options
  3. The code style is not very clear
  4. The algorithm of grid generator is extremely inefficient
